In This experiment,
I perform syllabification of text for names + 10K of Google words
then these words are used to form the syllables of the hotword decoder+ hotword list
The counts are also Sqrt!

I wish to try no _WB_ for lexicon entries of NON-hotwords
- you need to run  ./localrun_remove_WB_inNonHotWord.py --infile --opfile
after step forming the dataLG folder
